# Statistical Parametric Mapping

## Overview
Statistical Parametric Mapping is the construction and assessment of spatially extended statistical processes used to test hypotheses about functional imaging data. These ideas have been instantiated in a free and open source software that is called **SPM**.

The SPM software package has been designed for the analysis of brain imaging data sequences. The sequences can be a series of images from different cohorts, or time-series from the same subject. The current release is designed for the analysis of **fMRI**, **PET**, **SPECT**, **EEG** and **MEG**.
