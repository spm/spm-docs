SPM has a DICOM conversion utility that works with many different
variations of the DICOM format. It is accessible via the button \"DICOM
Import\" that will redirect you to the batch interface:

`SPM -> Util -> DICOM Import`

You will then have access to a number of options such as the choice of
single file (\'.nii\') or dual files (\'.img/.hdr\') NIfTI output
format.

If you encounter problems with your DICOM data, please email the [SPM
mailing list](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/support/) with details
about your scanner and acquisition settings (an example of a DICOM file
might be useful). This will contribute to make the DICOM conversion
utility even more robust.
