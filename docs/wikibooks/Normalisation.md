In order to compare data from several scans and / or research subjects,
all the brain images have to be in the same 3D space. In SPM this is
accomplished by \"normalizing\" the images into the space defined by the
Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template. Different versions of
SPM use different algorithms for this process. In general, the closer
the images start out to the MNI template orientation, the better the
outcome of the normalization.
