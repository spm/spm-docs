# Gain matrices for surfaces  
To compute new lead field/ gain matrices for multiple disto  

* **M/EEG datasets** (select files)  
Select the M/EEG mat file  

* **Inversion index** (enter text)  
Index of the cell in D.inv where the results will be stored.  

* **Use which head models** (choose from the menu)  
Select the head model to use  

* **Force recompute of lead fields** (choose from the menu)  
Will force recompute lead fields even if they exist  

* **Name of subdir to store leads** (enter text)  
Select name of the subdirectory to store leads in (normally seed001 etc)  

* **Removes all files in existing seed directory** (choose from the menu)  
Will force fresh empty directory for lead fields
