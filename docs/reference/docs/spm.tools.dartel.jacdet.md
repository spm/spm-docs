# Jacobian determinants  
Create Jacobian determinant fields from flowfields.   

* **Flow fields** (select files)  
The flow fields store the deformation information. The same fields can be used for both forward or backward deformations (or even, in principle, half way or exaggerated deformations).   

* **Time Steps** (choose from the menu)  
The number of time points used for solving the partial differential equations.  Note that Jacobian determinants are not very accurate for very small numbers of time steps (less than about 16).
