# SPM Installation

## Installation types

SPM can be installed in several ways. The recommended installation is within [MATLAB](./matlab.md). We also offer alternative installation modes that do not require a MATLAB license, including [Octave](./octave.md) and a precompiled [Standalone SPM](standalone.md). Use the menu on the left to learn more about each option.
