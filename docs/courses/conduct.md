# SPM code of conduct

## Why do we have a code of conduct?
We believe our spaces, both online and physical, should be free from harassment, bullying or hate. Our spaces should be safe for all those using them, and everyone who participates in an event has a responsibility to help us achieve this.

All attendees, speakers, hosts and volunteers at our events are required to agree with the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code throughout the event and we expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

## Code of conduct
We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any of our online events, including talks, workshops, socials, or other event types. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the event organisers.

**Participants and event attendees who display any behaviour considered harassment will be asked to leave the event immediately, or will be removed from the event by the event organiser.**

If you witness or experience harassment, please notify the event organiser immediately so that steps can be taken to remove participants.

Event organisers, providers and hosts are also subject to this code. In particular, event organisers, providers and hosts should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Event organisers, providers and hosts should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
