This course provides an introduction to MRI physics tailored to SPM for MRI. It covers:

- Fundamental principles of MRI, including tissue properties (e.g. T1 and T2 relaxation times) and sequence parameters (e.g. echo time, repetition time, flip angle)
- Image acquisition and acceleration techniques, including echo-planar, multiband, and parallel imaging.
- The physiological mechanisms underlying the BOLD response in fMRI.
- How BOLD sensitivity can be optimised through acquisition choices.
- Image distortion in echo-planar imaging and its correction using SPM.
- Anatomical MRI relevant to VBM and spatial normalisation.
- Common MRI artefacts.
