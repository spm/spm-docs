# MRI Physics Primer

## Learning objectives

1. Gain the skills to engage knowledgably with MRI physicists about the key parameters of an (f)MRI protocol.
2. Interpret MRI acquisition details reported in the methods section of a research paper.
3. Explain the trade-offs between acquisition speed, spatial resolution, coverage, and sensitivity.
4. Identify common MRI artefacts and determine which can be addressed using SPM.
