We are delighted to welcome visitors to our SPM courses every May and October. They are taught by an international faculty of SPM developers and collaborators, either online or in-person at the Functional Imaging Laboratory (FIL) in London. They form part of the [UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology's short course programme](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ion/education).

## About
Since 2010, we have provided two separate SPM courses reflecting the different imaging modalities. There is a four-day course on [SPM for EEG/MEG](./eeg_meg/index.md) followed by the three-day course on [SPM for MRI](./fmri_vbm/index.md). Both courses are suitable for beginners and more advanced users. We advise students to gain at least some minimal familiarity with the methodology, for example, from reading introductory articles available from the SPM webpage or by following data analysis examples in the [SPM tutorials](../tutorials/index.md).

Read more about the [SPM for M/EEG course](./eeg_meg/index.md) or the [SPM for MRI course](./fmri_vbm/index.md).

## Modes of attendance
The SPM courses are available in three modes: in person, online live, and online self-paced. All course formats include full access to lectures, slides, and hands-on tutorials. Choose the format that best suits your schedule and learning style

## FAQ

??? note "How often do the SPM courses run?"
    The SPM course for MRI is run in spring and autumn each year. The SPM course for M/EEG takes place in spring.

??? note "Do you teach PET as part of the programme?"
    We sometimes provide teaching on PET on the workshop day, however this is subject to the availability of staff. Most of the statistical concepts and techniques, which are taught on the course, are similar for both technologies.

??? note "Is the content of the spring MRI course different from the course offered in autumn?"
    They are the same.

??? note "Where can I access the materials for previous SPM courses?"
    Information and course materials can be accessed from the menu on this page.

??? note "Does the course count towards any credits for my MSc or postgraduate course?"
    Yes, if you are a UCL student. Students, however, must ensure they attend each session to claim these credits.

??? note "Can I pay for the course other than by credit or debit card?"
    Payment for the course is by debit or credit card only.

??? note "Can I get a refund of my fees if I am unable to attend?"
    You may be able to get a refund if you notify us at least two weeks before the start date of the course.

??? note "Can I get a discount if I am unemployed?"
    We regret we are not able to offer any discounts other than the discounted rate for students.
