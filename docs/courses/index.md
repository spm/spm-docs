We are delighted to welcome visitors to our SPM courses every spring and autumn. The courses are taught by an international faculty of SPM developers and collaborators, either online or in-person at the Functional Imaging Laboratory (FIL) in London. They form part of the [UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology's short course programme](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ion/education).

## About
Since 2010, we have provided separate SPM courses reflecting the different imaging modalities. There is a four-day course on [SPM for EEG/MEG](./eeg_meg/index.md) and a three-day course on [SPM for MRI](./fmri_vbm/index.md), with an occasional one-day MRI Physics Primer available as an optional module. The courses are suitable for beginners and more advanced users. We advise students to gain at least some minimal familiarity with the methodology, for example, from reading introductory articles available from the SPM webpage or by following data analysis examples in the [SPM tutorials](../tutorials/index.md).

Read more about the [SPM for M/EEG course](./eeg_meg/index.md) or the [SPM for MRI course](./fmri_vbm/index.md).

## FAQ

??? note "How often do the SPM courses run?"
    The SPM course for MRI is run in spring and autumn each year. The SPM course for M/EEG takes place in spring.

??? note "Do you teach PET as part of the programme?"
    We sometimes provide teaching on PET on the workshop day, however this is subject to the availability of staff. Most of the statistical concepts and techniques, which are taught on the course, are similar for both technologies.

??? note "Is the content of the spring MRI course different from the course offered in autumn?"
    They are the same.

??? note "Where can I access the materials for previous SPM courses?"
    Information and course materials can be accessed from the menu on this page.

??? note "Does the course count towards any credits for my MSc or postgraduate course?"
    Yes, if you are a UCL student. Students must register and log their attendance via Inkpath to claim these credits.

??? note "Can I pay for the course other than by credit or debit card?"
    Payment for the course is by debit or credit card only.

??? note "Can I get a refund of my fees if I am unable to attend?"
    You may be able to get a refund if you notify us at least two weeks before the start date of the course.

??? note "Can I get a discount if I am unemployed?"
    We regret we are not able to offer any discounts other than the discounted rate for students.

??? note "Do you offer fee waivers?"
    We provide a fee waiver option for individuals who reside and work in countries ranking on the [2025 UNESCO Institute of Statistics and World Bank List of Low and Lower-Middle Income Countries](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/files/faq/2025_UNESCO_List_Abstract_Fee_Waiver_FINAL.pdf) (based on gross national income per capita).
