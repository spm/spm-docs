This course introduces the analysis of neuroimaging data, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI). It covers:

- Experimental design
- Pre-processing brain images
- Quantifying structural changes in the brain (Voxel-Based Morphometry, VBM)
- Quantifying brain function (using the General Linear Model, GLM)
- Statistics for neuroimaging (frequentist and Bayesian)
- Connectivity analysis (Dynamic Causal Modelling, DCM)

The course is divided into theoretical and practical sessions, in which the SPM software package is used to analyse exemplar data sets. The SPM course is taught by an international faculty of neuroimaging experts from the Functional Imaging Laboratory (FIL) and collaborators. 

The course is suitable for beginners and more advanced users. 

Course programme is available [here](./programme.md).
