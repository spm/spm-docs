# Contrasts & classical inference

In this talk, [Dr Vasileia Kotoula](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/vasileia-kotoula) provides an overview of contrast and statistical inference in the context of the mass univariate approach. The discussion builds upon concepts presented earlier on the GLM and focuses on the latter part of the analysis pipeline.
