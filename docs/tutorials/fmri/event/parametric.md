# Modelling parametric responses

## Parametric modulators

Before setting up the design matrix, we must first load into MATLAB the
Stimulus Onsets Times (SOTs), as before, and also the "Lags", which are
specific to this experiment, and which will be used as parametric
modulators. The Lags code, for each second presentation of a face (N2
and F2), the number of other faces intervening between this (repeated)
presentation and its previous (first) presentation. Both SOTs and Lags
are represented by MATLAB cell arrays, stored in the `sots.mat` file.

- At the MATLAB command prompt type `load sots`. This loads the stimulus
  onset times and the lags (the latter in a cell array called `itemlag`.

## Model specification

Now press the `Specify 1st-level` button.
This will call up the specification of a fMRI specification job in the
batch editor window. Then:

- Press `File` and `Load batch`, select the `categorical_spec.mat` job file you
  created earlier.

- Open `Conditions` and then open the second `Condition`.

- Highlight `Parametric Modulations`, select `New Parameter`.

- Highlight `Name` and enter `Lag`, highlight values and enter
  `itemlag{2}`, highlight polynomial expansion and `2nd order`.

- Now open the fourth `Condition` under `Conditions`.

- Highlight `Parametric Modulations`, select `New Parameter`.

- Highlight `Name` and enter `Lag`, highlight `values` and enter
  `itemlag{4}`, highlight `polynomial expansion` and `2nd order`.

- Open `Canonical HRF` under `Basis Functions`, highlight `Model
  derivatives` and select `No derivatives` (to make the design matrix a
  bit simpler for present purposes!).

- Highlight `Directory` and select `DIR/parametric` (having "unselected"
  the currently defined folder from the Categorical analysis).

- Save the job as `parametric_spec` and press the `Run` button.

This should produce the design matrix shown below.

<figcaption><strong>Design matrix for testing repetition effects
parametrically.</strong> Regressor 2 indicates the second occurrence of
a nonfamous face. Regressor 3 modulates this linearly as a function of
lag (ie. how many faces have been shown since that face was first
presented), and regressor 4 modulates this quadratically as a function
of lag. Regressors 6,7 and 8 play the same roles, but for famous faces.

## Model estimation

Press the `Estimate` button. This will call
up the specification of an fMRI estimation job in the batch editor
window. Then

- Highlight the `Select SPM.mat` option and then choose the `SPM.mat`
  file saved in the `DIR/parametric` follder.

- Save the job as `parametric_est.job` and press the `Run` button.

SPM will write a number of files into the selected folder (directory) including
an `SPM.mat` file.

## Plotting parametric responses

We will look at the effect of lag (up to second order, ie using linear
and quadratic terms) on the response to repeated Famous faces, within
those regions generally activated by faces versus baseline. To do this

- Press `Results` and select the `SPM.mat` file in the `DIR/parametric`
  folder.

- Press `Define new contrast`, enter the name `Famous Lag`, press the
  `F-contrast` radio button, enter `1:6 9:15` in the `columns in reduced
  design` window, press `submit`, `OK` and `Done`.

- Select the `Famous Lag` contrast.

- *Apply masking ? \[None/Contrast/Image\]*

    * Specify `Contrast`.

- Select the `Positive Effect of Condition 1` T contrast.

    * Change to an `0.05` uncorrected mask p-value.

- Nature of Mask ? `inclusive`.

- *p value adjustment to control: \[FWE/none\]*

    * Select `None`.

- *Threshold {F or p value}*

    * Accept the default value, `0.001`.

- *Extent threshold {voxels} \[0\]*

    * Accept the default value, `0`.

The figure below shows the MIP and an overlay of
this parametric effect using overlays, sections and selecting the
`wmsM03953_0007.nii` image.

<figcaption>MIP and overlay of parametric lag effect in parietal
cortex.</figcaption>
</figure>

To plot the effect in the time domain:

- Right clicking on the MIP and selecting `global maxima`.

- Pressing `Plot`, and selecting `parametric responses` from the pull-down
  menu.

- Which effect ? select `F2`.

This shows a quadratic effect of lag, in which the response appears
negative for short-lags, but positive and maximal for lags of about 40
intervening faces (note that this is a very approximate fit, since there
are not many trials, and is also confounded by time during the session,
since longer lags necessarily occur later (for further discussion of
this issue, see the SPM2 example analysis of these data on the webpage).
