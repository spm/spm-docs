# Modelling categorical responses

## Onset times

Before setting up the design matrix we must first load the Stimulus
Onsets Times (SOTs) into MATLAB . SOTs are stored in the `sots.mat` file
in a cell array such that eg. `sot{1}` contains stimulus onset times in
TRs for event type 1, which is `N1`. Event-types 2, 3 and 4 are `N2`, `F1` and
`F2`.[^1]

- At the MATLAB command prompt type `load sots`

## Model specification

Now press the `Specify 1st-level` button.
This will call up the specification of a fMRI specification job in the
batch editor window. Then

- For `Directory`, select the `categorical` folder (directory) you created earlier,

- In the `Timing parameters` option,

- Highlight `Units for design` and select `Scans`,

- Highlight `Interscan interval` and enter `2`,

- Highlight `Microtime resolution` and enter `24`,

- Highlight `Microtime onset` and enter `12`. These last two options make
  the creating of regressors commensurate with the slice-time correction
  we have applied to the data, given that there are 24 slices and that
  the reference slice to which the data were slice-time corrected was
  the 12th (middle slice in time).

- Highlight `Data and Design` and select `New Subject/Session`.

- Highlight `Scans` and use SPM's file selector to choose the 351
  smoothed, normalised, slice-time corrected, realigned functional
  images ie `swarsM.img`. These can be selected easily using the
  `^swar.*` filter, and select all. Then press `Done`.

- Highlight `Conditions` and select `New condition`[^2].

- Open the newly created `Condition` option. Highlight `Name` and enter
  `N1`. Highlight `Onsets` and enter `sot{1}`. Highlight `Durations` and
  enter `0`.

- Highlight `Conditions` and select `Replicate condition`.

- Open the newly created `Condition` option (the lowest one). Highlight
  `Name` and change to `N2`. Highlight `Onsets` and enter `sot{2}`.

- Highlight `Conditions` and select `Replicate condition`.

- Open the newly created `Condition` option (the lowest one). Highlight
  `Name` and change to `F1`. Highlight `Onsets` and enter `sot{3}`.

- Highlight `Conditions` and select `Replicate condition`.

- Open the newly created `Condition` option (the lowest one). Highlight
  `Name` and change to `F2`. Highlight `Onsets` and enter `sot{4}`.

- Highlight `Multiple Regressors` and select the realignment parameter
  file `rp_sM03953_0005_0006.txt` file that was saved during the
  realignment preprocessing step in the folder containing the fMRI
  data[^3].

- Highlight `Factorial Design`, select `New Factor`, open the newly
  created `Factor` option, highlight `Name` and enter `Fam`, highlight
  `Levels` and enter `2`.

- Highlight `Factorial Design`, select `New Factor`, open the newly
  created `Factor` option, highlight `Name` and enter `Rep`, highlight
  `Levels` and enter 2[^4].

- Open `Canonical HRF` under `Basis Functions`. Select `Model
  derivatives` and select `Time and Dispersion derivatives`.

- Highlight `Directory` and select the `DIR/categorical` folder you
  created earlier.

- Save the job as `categorical_spec.mat` and press the `Run` button.

SPM will then write an `SPM.mat` file to the `DIR/categorical`
folder. It will also plot the design matrix, as shown below

<figure>
<div class="center">
<img src="../../../../assets/figures/manual/faces/cat_design.png" style="width:100mm" />
</div>
<figcaption>Design matrix</figcaption>
</figure>

At this stage it is advisable to check your model specification using
SPM's review facility which is accessed via the `Review` button. This
brings up a `Design` tab on the interactive window clicking on which
produces a pulldown menu. If you select the first item `Design Matrix`
SPM will produce the image shown above. If you select `Explore` then
`Session 1` then `N1`, SPM will produce the plots shown below.

<figure>
<div class="center">
<img src="../../../../assets/figures/manual/faces/cat_explore.png" style="width:100mm" />
</div>
<figcaption><strong>Exploring the design matrix</strong>. This shows the time series
of the "N1" regressor (top left), the three basis functions used to
convert assumed neuronal activity into hemodynamic activity (bottom
left), and a frequency domain plot of the three regressors for the basis
functions in this condition (top right). The frequency domain plot shows
that the frequency content of the "N1" condition is generally above the
set frequencies that are removed by the High Pass Filter (HPF) (these
are shown in grey - in this model we accepted the default HPF cut-off of
128s or 0.008Hz).</figcaption>
</figure>

## Model estimation

Press the `Estimate` button. This will call
up the specification of an fMRI estimation job in the batch editor
window. Then

- Highlight the `Select SPM.mat` option and then choose the `SPM.mat`
  file saved in the `DIR/categorical` folder.

- Save the job as `categorical_est.job` and press `Run` button.

SPM will write a number of files into the selected folder including
an `SPM.mat` file.

## Inference for categorical design

Press "Results" and select the SPM.mat file from `DIR/categorical`. This
will again invoke the contrast manager. Because we specified that our
model was using a "Factorial design" a number of contrasts have been
specified automatically, as shown below.

<figure>
<div class="center">
<img src="../../../../assets/figures/manual/faces/cat_contrasts.png" style="width:100mm" />
</div>
<figcaption>Contrast Manager containing default contrasts for
categorical design.</figcaption>
</figure>

- Select contrast number 5. This is a t-contrast
  `Positive effect of condition_1` This will show regions where the
  average effect of presenting faces is significantly positive, as
  modelled by the first regressor (hence the `_1`), the canonical HRF.
  Press `Done`.

- *Apply masking ? \[None/Contrast/Image\]*

    * Specify `None`.

- *p value adjustment to control: \[FWE/none\]*

    * Select `FWE`.

- *Corrected p value(family-wise error)*

    * Accept the default value, `0.05`

- *Extent threshold {voxels} \[0\]*

    * Accept the default value, `0`.

SPM will then produce the MIP shown below.

### Statistical tables

To get a summary of local maxima, press the `whole brain` button in the
p-values section of the interactive window. This will list all clusters
above the chosen level of significance as well as separate
($>$8mm apart) maxima within a cluster, with details of
significance thresholds and search volume underneath.

<figure>
<div class="center">
<img src="../../../../assets/figures/manual/faces/cat5_volume.png" style="width:100mm" />
</div>
<figcaption><strong>MIP and Volume table for Canonical HRF</strong>:
Faces &gt; Baseline.</figcaption>
</figure>

The columns in volume table show, from right to left:

- **x, y, z (mm)**: coordinates in MNI space for each maximum.

- **peak-level**: the chance (p) of finding (under the null hypothesis)
  a peak with this or a greater height (T- or Z-statistic), corrected
  (FWE or FDR) / uncorrected for search volume.

- **cluster-level**: the chance (p) of finding a cluster with this
  many(ke) or a greater number of voxels, corrected (FWE or FDR) /
  uncorrected for search volume.

- **set-level**: the chance (p) of finding this (c) or a greater number
  of clusters in the search volume.

Right-click on the MIP and select `goto global maximum`. The cursor will
move to \[`39 -70 -14`\]. You can view this activation on the subject's
normalised, intensity nonuniformity corrected structural (`wmsM03953_0007iÌ‡mg`), which gives
best anatomical precision, or on the normalised mean functional
(`wmeansM03953_0005_0006.nii`), which is closer to the true data and
spatial resolution (including distortions in the functional EPI data).

If you select `plot` and choose `Contrast of estimates and 90% C.I`
(confidence interval), and select the `Average effect of condition`
contrast, you will see three bars corresponding to the parameter
estimates for each basis function (summed across the 4 conditions). The
BOLD impulse response in this voxel loads mainly on the canonical HRF,
but also significantly (given that the error bars do not overlap zero)
on the temporal and dispersion derivatives (see next Chapter).

### F-contrasts

To assess the main effect of repeating faces, as characterised by both
the hrf *and* its derivatives, an F-contrats is required. This is really
asking whether repetition changes the *shape* of the impulse response
(e.g, it might affect its latency but not peak amplitude), at least the
range of shapes defined by the three basis functions. Because we have
told SPM that we have a factorial design, this required contrast will
have been created automatically - it is number 3.

- Press `Results` and select the `SPM.mat` file in the `DIR/categorical`
  folder.

- Select the `F-contrast` toggle and the contrast number 3, as shown in
  the next image. Press `Done`.

- *Apply masking ? \[None/Contrast/Image\]*.

    * Specify `Contrast`.

    * Select contrast 5 - `Positive effect of condition_1` (the T-contrast
  of activation versus baseline, collapsed across conditions, that we
  evaluated above)

- *uncorrected mask p-value ?*

    * Change to `0.001`.

- *nature of mask?*

    * Select `inclusive`.

- *p value adjustment to control: \[FWE/none\]*

    * Select `none`.

- *threshold (F or p value)*

    * Accept the default value, `0.001`.

- *Extent threshold {voxels} \[0\]*

    * Accept the default value, `0`.

A MIP should then appear, the top half of which should look like
the figure below.

<figure>
<div class="center">

<figure>
<div class="center">

</div>
<figcaption>MIP for Main effect of Rep, masked inclusively with
Canonical HRF: Faces &gt; Baseline at
p&lt;.001 uncorrected. Shown below are
the best-fitting responses and peri-stimulus histograms (PSTH) for F1
and F2.</figcaption>
</figure>

Note that this contrast will identify regions showing any effect of
repetition (e.g, decreased or increased amplitudes) *within* those
regions showing activations (on the canonical HRF) to faces versus
baseline (at p$<$.05 uncorrected). Select "goto global max", which is in
right ventral temporal cortex \[`42 -64 -8`\].

If you press plot and select `Event-related responses`, then `F1`, then
`fitted response and PSTH`, you will see the best fitting linear
combination of the canonical HRF and its two derivatives (thin red
line), plus the "selectively-averaged" data (peri-stimulus histogram,
PSTH), based on an FIR refit (see next Chapter). If you then select the
`hold` button on the Interactive window, and then `plot` and repeat the
above process for the `F2` rather than `F1` condition, you will see two
estimated event-related responses, in which repetition decreases the
peak response (ie `F2`$<$`F1`), as shown in the figure above.

You can explore further F-contrasts, which are a powerful tool once you
understand them. For example, the MIP produced by the "Average effect of
condition" F-contrast looks similar to the earlier T-contrast, but
importantly shows the areas for which the sums across conditions of the
parameter estimates for the canonical hrf *and/or* its temporal
derivative *and/or* its dispersion derivative are different from zero
(baseline). The first row of this F-contrast (\[`1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
0`\]) is also a two-tailed version of the above T-contrast, ie testing
for both activations and deactivations versus baseline. This also means
that the F-contrasts \[`1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0`\] and \[`-1 0 0 -1 0 0 -1
0 0 -1 0 0`\] are equivalent. Finally, note that an F- (or t-) contrast
such as \[`1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`\], which tests whether the mean of the
canonical hrf AND its derivatives for all conditions are different from
(larger than) zero is not sensible. This is because the canonical hrf
and its temporal derivative may cancel each other out while being
significant in their own right. The basis functions are really quite
different things, and need to represent separate rows in an F-contrast.

### F-contrasts for testing effects of movement

To assess movement-related activation

- Press `Results`, select the `SPM.mat` file, select `F-contrast` in the
  Contrast Manager. Specify e.g. `Movement-related effects` (name) and
  in the `contrasts weights matrix` window, or `1:12 19` in the `columns
  for reduced design` window.

- Submit and select the contrast, specify `Apply masking?` (none),
  `corrected height threshold` (FWE), and `corrected p-value` (accept
  default).

- When the MIP appears, select `sections` from the `overlays` pulldown
  menu, and select the normalised structural image
  (`wmsM03953_0007.nii`).

You will see there is a lot of residual movement-related artifact in the
data (despite spatial realignment), which tends to be concentrated near
the boundaries of tissue types (eg the edge of the brain; see
below). (Note how the MIP can be
misleading in this respect, since though it appears that the whole brain
is affected, this reflects the nature of the (X-ray like) projections
onto each orthogonal view; displaying the same data as sections in 3D
shows that not every voxel is suprathreshold.) Even though we are not
interested in such artifact, by including the realignment parameters in
our design matrix, we "covary out" (linear components) of subject
movement, reducing the residual error, and hence improve our statistics
for the effects of interest.

<figure>
<div class="center">
<img src="../../../../assets/figures/manual/faces/movements.png" style="width:100mm" />
</div>
<figcaption>Movement-related activations. These spurious
â€˜activationsâ€™ are due to residual movement of the head during scanning.
These effects occur at tissue boundaries and boundaries between brain
and non-brain, as this is where contrast differences are greatest.
Including these regressors in the design matrix means these effects
cannot be falsely attributed to neuronal activity.</figcaption>

[^1]: Unlike previous analyses of these data in SPM99 and SPM2, we will
    not bother with extra event-types for the (rare) error trials.

[^2]: It is also possible to enter information about all of the
    conditions in one go. This requires much less button pressing and
    can be implemented by highlighting the "Multiple conditions" option
    and then selecting the `all-conditions.mat` file, which is also
    provided on the webpage.

[^3]: It is also possible to enter regressors one by one by highlighting
    "Regressors" and selecting "New Regressor" for each one. Here, we
    benefit from the fact that the realignment stage produced a text
    file with the correct number of rows (351) and columns (6) for SPM
    to add 6 regressors to model (linear) rigid-body movement effects.

[^4]: The order of naming these factors is important - the factor to be
    specified first is the one that "changes slowest" ie. as we go
    through the list of conditions N1, N2, F1, F2 the factor
    "repetition" changes every condition and the factor "fame" changes
    every other condition. So "Fam" changes slowest and is entered
    first.
